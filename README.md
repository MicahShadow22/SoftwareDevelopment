My Bio: I love gaming(like minecraft and other games), i love helping people and learning to code.
I'm taking this program to learn how to code and use that knowledge to make apps and games that improve and enrich people's lives as well as help people with disabilities navigate life and also help them with their goals and dreams. My other goal is to make games that are accessible to everyone so they all can enjoy without feeling left out.
